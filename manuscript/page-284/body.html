<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">rights will be protected, and every new development will be given sufficient scope.</p><p>Our people will be made thoroughly acquainted with all these matters.</p><p>We shall not take others unawares or mislead them, any more than we shall deceive ourselves.</p><p>Everything must be systematically settled beforehand. I merely indicate this scheme: our keenest thinkers will combine in elaborating it. Every social and technical achievement of our age and of the more advanced age which will be reached before the slow execution of my plan is accomplished must be employed for this object. Every valuable invention which exists now, or lies in the future, must be used. By these means a country can be occupied and a State founded in a manner as yet unknown to history, and with possibilities of success such, as never occurred before.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
