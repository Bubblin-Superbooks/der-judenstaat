We shall take what is given us, and what is selected by Jewish public opinion. The Society will determine both these points.</p><p>Argentine is one of the most fertile countries in the world, extends over a vast area, has a sparse population and a mild climate. The Argentine Republic would derive considerable profit from the cession of a portion of its territory to us. The present infiltration of Jews has  certainly produced some discontent, and it would be necessary to enlighten the Republic on the intrinsic difference of our new movement.</p></div> </div>
