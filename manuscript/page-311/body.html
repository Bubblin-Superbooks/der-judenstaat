It is precisely the poorest whom we need at first.

Our rich, who have a pleasurable acquaintance with all our technical achievements, know full well how much money can do. And thus it will be; just the poor and simple, who do not know what power man already exercises over the forces of Nature, just these will have the firmest faith in the new message. For these have never lost their hope of the Promised Land.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Here it is, fellow Jews! Neither fable nor deception!</p></div> </div>
