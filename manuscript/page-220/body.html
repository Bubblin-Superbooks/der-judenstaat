<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Promotion Of Industries</h4><p class="  start-chapter">The duties of the Jewish Company and the Society of Jews cannot be kept strictly apart in this outline. These two great bodies will have to work constantly in unison, the Company depending on the moral authority and support of the Society, just as the Society cannot dispense with the material assistance of the Company.
